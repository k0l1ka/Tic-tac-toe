this is a realization of tic-tac-toe for removed players
programs using sockets (tcp/ip protocol) for communication

1)variant

to run this code you need:
-- type make in your terminal. this will create executables first, second and server.
-- you can run this executables from three different systems
-- server does need any comand line parameters and must be executed before both first and second
-- both first and second are executed each with one parameter = ip of server (inet addr: ***.***.*.**) of system where server is ran
-- the process of game is simple (there are some tips). two players use first and second to send and receive info
-- at the and of game all three processes are terminated by themselves.

NOTE: to play the game for the second time you should wait for a moment in order socket_adress to be left free by server from the previous time

2)variant

Also a library is created over here. It is in lib/ and was created in the current directory using makefile_for_lib in the following way:
> make -f makefile_for_lib

To compile,for example, server.cpp as an alternative to the method below you need to type in terminal this:
> g++ server.cpp -I./include -Llib -lTictacField -o server
